This section of the wiki provides background on the project, the features of the MyFDA prototype,
and future features envisioned for the prototype concept.

Background
----------

The GSA released an RFQ for Agile Delivery Services asking bidders to provide Agile design and 
development services to the 18F group within the GSA.  As part of this RFQ, GSA has asked bidders 
to use agile delivery to produce a functioning prototype application, which utilizes at a minimum,
the openFDA API as a source of data.  As part of its proposal, NIC Federal, LLC (formerly named NIC 
Technologies, LLC) herein NIC, a leader in providing digital services to government developed the 
MyFDA prototype to demonstrate the potential uses of this data.  This prototype was developed over 
an eight day period with an agile team staffed with experienced technology and design resources.

To develop the concept, a group of innovative thinkers across NIC's business units were provided 
background information on the openFDA datasets and the general objectives of the prototype.  This
ideation team was asked to develop simple problem/solution proposals and to discuss these ideas 
as a group.  As the discussion progressed, the idea of providing a personalized portal to FDA 
drug information emerged because it presented the most value to the largest user audience and the 
team concluded that finding and understanding the open datasets published by the FDA was a 
compelling problem to solve for the general population.
