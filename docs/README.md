Project Documentation
=====================

This is an index of the project documentation for the MyFDA prototype.  A markdown wiki format has been
used for all documentation.  Project documentation is organized into three categories.  Project
Information is the first category and includes information on the approach used for the project.
The second category is Technical Information, and includes documentation intended for developers
wishing to install or contribute to the project.  Finally, the Additional Documentation section
contains documentation that does not fit into the other two categories.
